Where I Have Used AI

I used AI to help me understand the weekly topics of the FOCP (Fundamentals of Computer Programming) module, including Python concepts such as variables, control statements, functions, data structures, and file handling.

AI was also used to summarise lecture content into clear notes, to organise information into a structured format, and to help write the README and Markdown files in a simple and readable way.

I did not use AI to complete assessments automatically. I used it as a study and writing support tool to improve my understanding and presentation of my work.
