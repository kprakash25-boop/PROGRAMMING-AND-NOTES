## What I Learned

### Variables and Data Types
I learned how variables are used to store data in memory and how different data types such as integers, floats, and strings are used in Python. I also learned how to take user input using the `input()` function and display output using `print()`.

### Control Statements
I learned how to control the flow of a program using conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for` and `while`). These allow a program to make decisions and repeat actions when required.

### Functions
I learned how to create and use functions to organise code into reusable blocks. Functions help make programs easier to read, test, and maintain by breaking complex tasks into smaller parts.

### Input, Output, and File Handling
I learned how to read data from users and files, and how to write data to text files. This allows programs to store information permanently and process external data.

## How I Used These Topics in Task 1 and Task 2

### Use of Variables and Data Types
In Task 1 (Pizza Order Program), I used variables to store pizza prices as floating-point numbers and calculate totals and discounts.  
In Task 2 (Password Verification Program), I used string variables to store the password and individual characters for comparison.

### Use of Control Statements
In Task 1, control statements were used to validate user input and ensure that only positive prices were accepted. Conditional logic was also used to apply the four-for-three offer correctly.  
In Task 2, conditional statements were used to check password length and immediately exit the program if a security check failed.

### Use of Functions
Both Task 1 and Task 2 use functions to separate logic into clear sections, such as validating input, calculating discounts, and checking password characters. This made the programs easier to understand and reduced repetition.

### Use of Input, Output, and File Handling
In Task 1, file handling was used to save pizza order details and display previous orders and statistics.  
In Task 2, input and output were used to interact with the user during the security checks and display results clearly.

## Summary
Through these tasks, I applied core Python concepts learned in Weeks 1–8 to create complete command-line programs. The assignments helped me understand how basic programming concepts work together to solve real-world problems in a structured and logical way.
