#Week 1 – Introduction to Programming

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to solve
problems. Python is a high-level language that uses simple English-like
syntax. An algorithm is a step-by-step plan used to solve a task. A
Python program runs line by line from top to bottom.

#Week 2 – Variables and Types

Variables store data in memory. Python supports integers for whole
numbers, floats for decimal numbers, and strings for text. User input is
taken using input() and output is shown using print().

#Week 3 – Control Statements

Control statements allow a program to make decisions. Using if, elif,
and else, a program selects which code runs based on conditions.

#Week 4 – Functions

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a task.
Functions reduce repetition and make programs easier to manage. They can
take inputs and return results.

#Week 5 – Scripts and Modules

A script is a Python file that runs code. A module is a file that
contains functions and variables that can be imported. Python includes
built-in modules such as math and random.

#Week 6 – Lists and Tuples

Lists store multiple values and can be changed. Tuples also store
multiple values but cannot be modified. Both use indexing that starts
from zero.

#Week 7 – Sets and Dictionaries

A set stores unique values. A dictionary stores data using key-value
pairs for fast access.

#Week 8 – Input/Output and File Handling

File handling allows data to be saved and loaded. Files can be opened in
read or write mode to store information permanently.

Learning outcome 

By Week 8, students can write Python programs, make decisions, use
functions, manage data collections, and store data using files.
