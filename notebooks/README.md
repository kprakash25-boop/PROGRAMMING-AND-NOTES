Week 1 – Introduction to Programming

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to solve problems. Python is a high-level language that uses simple English-like syntax. An algorithm is a step-by-step plan used to solve a task. A Python program runs line by line from top to bottom.



Week 2 – Variables and Types

Variables are used to store data in memory. Python supports different data types such as integers for whole numbers, floats for decimal numbers, and strings for text. User input is taken using input() and results are shown using print().



Week 3 – Control Statements

Control statements allow a program to make decisions. Using if, elif, and else, a program can choose which code to run based on conditions such as comparisons and logical tests.



Week 4 – Functions

A function is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help reduce repetition and make programs easier to manage. They can receive data as parameters and return results.



Week 5 – Scripts and Modules

A Python script is a file that contains executable code. A module is a file that stores useful functions and variables that can be imported into other programs. Python provides built-in modules such as math and random.



Week 6 – Lists and Tuples

Lists store multiple values in one variable and can be changed. Tuples also store multiple values but cannot be modified. Both use indexing, which starts from zero.



Week 7 – Sets and Dictionaries

A set stores unique values without duplicates. A dictionary stores data in key–value pairs, allowing fast access to stored information.



Week 8 – Input/Output and File Handling

File handling allows programs to save and retrieve data. Files can be opened in different modes such as read and write. This makes data storage permanent and allows information to be reused later.


Learning Outcome

By the end of Week 8, students can write structured Python programs, make decisions, reuse code, manage collections of data, and store information using files. These skills form the foundation of programming and problem solving in Python.
