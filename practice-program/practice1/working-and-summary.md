How This Program Works
	1.	Prompting the User:
The program asks the user to enter the price of four pizzas one by one.
	2.	Input Validation:
Each input is checked to ensure it is a positive number.
	•	If the input is negative, zero, or not a number, the program asks the user to enter the price again.
	3.	Finding the Cheapest Pizza:
Once all four prices are valid, the program identifies the cheapest pizza, which will be free under the offer.
	4.	Calculating Total and Discount:
	•	The total amount to pay is the sum of all four pizzas minus the cheapest one.
	•	The discount percentage is calculated as:

discount = (price of cheapest pizza / sum of all pizzas) * 100


	5.	Displaying the Result:
The program prints:
	•	The total amount the customer has to pay.
	•	The discount percentage they received.
	6.	End of Program:
The program finishes after displaying the results. No further input is needed.
