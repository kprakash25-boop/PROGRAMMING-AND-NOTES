Program Summary

This program allows a user to enter a password and performs a security check in two steps:
	1.	Password Length Check
	•	The program first asks the user to enter a password.
	•	If the password is less than 9 characters, the program stops and informs the user that the password is too short.
    
	2.	Random Letter Verification
	•	If the password is long enough, the program randomly selects three positions in the password.
	•	The user is asked to enter the letter at each of these positions.
	•	If the user enters any letter incorrectly, the program immediately stops and shows “Security check failed.”
	•	If all three letters are entered correctly, the program shows “Security check passed.”
